# Hotels Database SQL Exercises

## Overview
This repository contains a series of SQL exercises and solutions related to the management of a hypothetical Hotels Database. These exercises are designed to practice SQL skills including table creation, data manipulation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), and data retrieval using SELECT statements with various clauses and conditions.

## Contents
The repository consists of four files, each addressing a different aspect of SQL operations:

1. **CreateTables.sql** - Contains SQL commands to create tables with constraints for the Hotels database.
2. **DataManipulation.sql** - Includes SQL queries for inserting, deleting, and updating records in the database.
3. **BasicSelectQueries.sql** - Provides a series of SELECT statements for basic data retrieval tasks.
4. **AdvancedSelectQueries.sql** - Offers complex SQL queries including subselects, grouping, and joins for advanced data retrieval needs.

## Structure

### Hotels Database Schema
The database includes the following tables:
- **Hotel:** Contains details about hotels.
- **Room:** Stores room details for each hotel.
- **Booking:** Includes booking details.
- **Guest:** Contains guest details.

### SQL Exercises
The exercises are categorized as follows:
- **Table Creation and Constraints:** Defining the database schema with appropriate keys and constraints.
- **Data Manipulation:** Techniques for adding, modifying, and removing data.
- **Data Retrieval (Basic and Advanced):** Queries ranging from simple data retrieval to complex joins and aggregations.

## Usage
Each SQL file is a standalone document containing a series of SQL commands or queries. These can be executed in any MySQL/MariaDB environment. Ensure that the database is set up according to the schema defined in the `CreateTables.sql` before running data manipulation and retrieval queries.
