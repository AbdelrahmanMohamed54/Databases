# Databases Repository

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to represent my progress in solving SQL exercises and learning materials focused on database management and operations. It includes two main directories: 'Hotel-SQL' and 'messenger-app', each containing a series of structured SQL exercises and solutions for two different database projects.

## Repository Structure

### 1. Hotel-SQL
This directory contains exercises related to the 'Hotels' database. It includes SQL scripts for creating tables, manipulating data, and performing both basic and advanced data retrieval operations.

#### Contents:
- **CreateTables.sql:** SQL commands for creating tables with constraints.
- **DataManipulation.sql:** Queries for inserting, deleting, and updating records.
- **BasicSelectQueries.sql:** Basic data retrieval queries using SELECT statements.
- **AdvancedSelectQueries.sql:** Advanced data retrieval queries, including subselects, grouping, and joins.
- **README.md:** Describes the purpose and contents of the 'Hotel-SQL' directory.

### 2. messenger-app
This directory focuses on a 'Messenger' database, detailing the creation and manipulation of a messaging application's database.

#### Contents:
- **Messenger-SQL1.md:** Defines the structure of the Messenger database tables, including SQL commands for table creation.
- **Messenger-SQL2.md:** Demonstrates basic SQL operations like update, delete, and select on the Messenger database.
- **Messenger-SQL3.md:** Complex SQL queries for advanced data retrieval and analysis within the Messenger database.
- **ER-Modelling (Folder):** Contains Entity-Relationship models and relational models for the Messenger App.
    - **Basic-ER-Model.png:** Basic ER model showing only entities and relationships.
    - **Complete-ER-Model.png:** Full ER model including entities, relationships, and attributes.
    - **Full-relational-model.png:** Full relational model derived from the ER model of the Messenger App.

#### Notes:
- The SQL commands are tailored for MySQL/MariaDB and assume basic familiarity with SQL syntax and database concepts.
- The exercises progressively cover various aspects of SQL, from fundamental commands to complex queries.

## Usage
- The SQL files and markdown documents can be used as a reference or guide for similar database projects.
- The ER models provide a visual representation of database structures, useful for understanding and designing databases.
